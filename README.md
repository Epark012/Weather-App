# WPF MVVM Project with API Integration

## Overview
This project is a demonstration of a WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) application implemented using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern. The primary goal is to showcase how to integrate APIs within a WPF MVVM framework.

## Features
- **MVVM Architecture:** The project follows the MVVM pattern to separate concerns and improve maintainability.
- **API Integration:** Demonstrates the integration of APIs to fetch and display data within the WPF application.
- **Asynchronous Programming:** Utilizes asynchronous programming techniques to ensure a responsive user interface while fetching data from APIs.
- **Data Binding:** Utilizes data binding to connect the UI components with the underlying ViewModel and Model.

## Technologies Used
- **WPF:** Windows Presentation Foundation for building the user interface.
- **MVVM Light Toolkit:** A popular MVVM framework for WPF applications.
- **HttpClient:** Used for making HTTP requests to APIs.
- **JSON.NET:** For parsing and handling JSON data.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Visual Studio (or any preferred WPF development environment)
- .NET Framework

### Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git`
2. Open the solution file in Visual Studio.
3. Build the solution.

### Configuration
- Update API keys or endpoints in the configuration file if applicable.

## Usage
- Run the application and explore the features.
- Navigate through the UI to see how MVVM architecture facilitates data flow.

## Folder Structure
- **/Views:** Contains XAML files for UI.
- **/ViewModels:** Houses ViewModel classes.
- **/Models:** Includes Model classes for data representation.
- **/Services:** Contains classes responsible for API integration.
- **/Helpers:** Utility classes and helper methods.
